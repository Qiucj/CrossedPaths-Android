# CrossedPaths-Android
A Decentralized COVID-19 Exposure Notification App for Android Devices
## Description
- Users can activate CrossedPaths to track their time-stamped locations.     

- Each time-stamped location is recorded and stored as an irreversible digital token.   

- There exists an anonymous database of the digital tokens of users confirmed to have COVID-19.   

- All users can locally compare their tokens with those in the database to check for time-stamped location overlaps.   

- Location collection and the sending of digital tokens is completely voluntary.   

- Users can join organizations in the app so their locations are only recorded when in the organization's established boundaries.
