# CrossedPaths-Android
A Decentralized COVID-19 Exposure Notification App for Android Devices
## Description
-Users can activate the app track their time-stamped location.     

-Each time-stamped location is recorded and stored as an irreversible digital token.   

-There exists an anonymous database of the digital tokens of users confirmed to have COVID-19.   

-All users can locally compare their tokens with those in the database to check for time-stamped location overlaps.   

-Location collection and the sending of digital tokens is completely voluntary.   

-Users can join specific organizations on the app so their time-stamped locations are only recorded when in the organization's established boundaries.
